	<h1>FAQ</h1>
	<dl id="faq">
		<dt>What is TradeSparrow?</dt>
		<dd>We provide web tools to perform technical analysis on stocks/equities.Our tools are efficient and super easy to use so that newbies and casual traders/investors can jump in right away.</dd>

		<dt>What is technical trading?</dt>
			<dd>This is a method of trading where buying and selling decisions can be
reasoned as follows: "hey I've seen this kind of price movement
pattern many times before and 9 out of 10 times it moves higher over
the next hour/day/week/month.  There is a good chance that if I can
profit if I enter."  You are identifying repeating patterns and acting
on the fact that these patterns indicate a higher probability of one
outcome over another.</dd>
	<dt>If this works, then why does it work? Do such patterns really exist?</dt>
		<dd>I'm assuming you're a small investor ($10k - $50k). Large investors
			($100's of millions) have an overwhelming effect in which direction a
			stock goes.  When they decide to enter (or exit), they are going to
			leave a trace one way or another.  If you can pick up those traces or
			patterns, then you can ride the wave on the back of the whale.</dd>


		<dt>Okay I get it, but can I really compete against those guys, you know, the guys with the super computers and PhD programmers?</dt>
			<dd>You (the small guy) are a minnow.  You can move quick, increase or
			reduce risk exposure at a drop of the hat.  Those big players with
			$100's millions or $billions? They have to use every speed trick they
			can get, whether it's faster programs or faster computers, just to
			make their whale look and act like a minnow.  They have to be able
			move their money without drawing attention or making huge waves.  They
			can try.  You have the innate advantage of being small.</dd>


		<dt>My financial adviser and the mainstream media consistently preach that I cannot beat the market by trading it.</dt>
			<dd>Tell that to Goldman Sachs.  Here is the fact of the numbers: Suppose
			you picked a day to buy a stock at the closing price with the intent
			to sell it at the close within the next 30 days.  What is the
			probability that there will be the opportunity to sell this stock at a
			profit? The answer is 29/30, or a 96.7% chance of winning.  There is
			only one day out of the total 30 days that you could have bought at
			the absolute highest price and hence a 1/30 (3.3%) chance  that makes
			this trade a definite loser from the start.  Despite the odds, most
			traders will not be able to turn a profit. When the stock moves in the
			trader's favor, he holds (greed).  When the price turns around and
			erases all his gain, which it surely will as there is also only a 3.3%
			chance that he bought at the perfectly lowest price, then he sells
			(fear).  Rinse and repeat. By using technical signals a trader can
			keep greed and fear in check and reduce the odds of staying in a trade
			too long or exiting too early.</dd>


		<dt>Are you guys financial advisers?</dt>
			<dd>No.</dd>


		<dt>There are other tools out there with a lot more bells and whistles.Why should I use yours?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>We are not the most feature-loaded tool.  We probably have the least features by count.  We focus on solving the problem differently.  One goal in particular is to make the tool easy to use.  We do this by:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Not asking you to learn some obscure programming language or become a programmer in order to work the tool</li>
					<li>Not requiring you to install a bloated, fugly Windows program loaded with a dozen screens and two dozen buttons and settings</li>
					<li>Not asking you commit $5k-$10k to open a trading account before giving full access to the tool</li>
					<li>Not charging you $100s or $1000s for the software on top of monthly data fees.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>You can get started with us right away defining strategies with good heuristics and back testing them in under 10 seconds - and for free. That is easy to use.</p>
			</dd>
		<dt>Can you guarantee that I will make money if I use your stuff?</dt>
			<dd>No.</dd>

		<dt>Why are you doing this?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>On September 14th 2010, a AP-CNBC poll revealed that:
			"the perception that the market is unfair is widespread. Nearly 90
			percent of those with portfolios of less than $50,000 said the market
			is unfair to small investors. ...More than 75 percent of investors
			worth at least $250,000 say the market is unfair to the little guy."
			We have noticed this as well.  Huge sums money have been shifted out
			of Main Street and channeled into Wall Street mega funds in a bid to
			seek higher returns trading against the little guy.  To whatever
			extent we can do, we would like to see the trend reverse by seeing the
			little guy play better.
			</p>
			</dd>

		<dt>How are you going to make money from this?</dt>
			<dd>We will add premium features in the future.  For now we're in beta so take advantage to use what we offer.</dd>


		<dt>Who are you guys?</dt>
			<dd>Our names are Nick Johnson, Stuart Ross, and Jonathan Ho.  We are 3 programmers in Austin, Texas.</dd>
